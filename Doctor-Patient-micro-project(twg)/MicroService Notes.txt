MicroServices
======================

-->microservices are modern approach in software where by application code devided in small, managable pieces,independent to others.
-->microservices are small small services they work together 
-->microservices are loosely coupled ->( meaning that changes to one service should not affect the other services )
-->it is distributed environment =>not all application code at one place (based on modules devided diff applications)


Monolith Archetecture
===========================
-->Single and large Code Base    => whole code application available at one place
-->Single Stack                  =>every modules in the application developed by one progarmming language(like java)
-->tightly coupled               =>all modules are tightly coupled each other
-->it is centalized environment  =>all application available at one place
-->one time deployement for entire project=> means in the application if single modules got any issue then project not deployed 

MicroServices Communication
====================================
-->one micro service communicates with another microservice
-->there are ways for micro service communication
1)Synchronous 
2)Asyncronous


1)Synchronous 
-----------------
-->it means ,if one micro-service send request to another micro-service 
-->in this, sending micro-service waits for the second micro-service response(blocking)
-->RestTemplate,SpringCloud using communications are Synchronous 

ex:
-----
phone call 
-->we waited untill another person giving the response

2)Asyncronous
---------------
-->it means ,if one micro-service send request to another micro-service 
-->sending microservice will not wait for the second micro service for the response(non-blocking)
-->RabbitMQ,Kafka are the example

ex:
-----
chatting(in whatsapp,etc..)
-->sending person put the message and not wait or stop his work for the response


Micro-service Architecture Components
=======================================================

Note = for architecture diagram search in google spring microservices(https://spring.io/microservices) then you will get official and in that diagram you will find

Api gateway
<============>
-->api gateway acts like gate for microservices
-->means every request go through this gateway only
-->every request come to api-gateway first  and then it will route correspondent micro-service
-->Api Gateway simplifies complexity of client & microservices communication



ConfigServer
<=============>
--> Actually a multiple micro-servives are developed in the micro-service based application
-->each micro-service is a application
-->so each application needs configurations
-->in ConfigServer means all the micro-services confifgurations are maintained here only
-->it is a centralized configurations maintainer
-->if i want change any particular micro-service configurations then no need to go that particular micro-service in configServer we can easily change


Circuit breaker
<=====================>
-->if two micro-services are there(One,Two)
-->if Two micro-service needs One-Microservice data
-->in case if One micro-service fails or not-working
-->that time we need to handle bcz Two-Micro-service don't know One-Micro-service is not working
-->for handling this kind of situation Circuit Breaker need to use

message borker
<===================>
-->apache kafka is a message broker
-->for communication of micro-service this message broker used

ex:zomato app
------------------
-->first order request came to one micro-service 
-->that micro-service intimate to kafka like hey order req came from clinet
-->then after payment micro-service handles payment process 
-->then payment handled micro-service intimate to kafka like either payment =sucess or payment=failure
-->based on kafka message success failure remaing will continue ,etc...


service-regstry
<===================>
-->for communication of micro-services network location is required(servername,portnumber,ect..)
-->instaed of hardcoding the n/w location use eurka server 
-->euraka server is a service-registry and discovery server 
-->when the micro-services running/startup they registed in the euraka server itself then euraka know his n/w location
-->so through this eureka micro-services communicate each other


OpenFeign
=======================
-->it is also like RestTemplate and Webcleint
-->used for make micro-services communicate each other
-->by default it is synchronous 
-->it follows thred-per-request model

how to use openfeign
-----------------------------

-->1.add dependecny  and Add @EnableFeignClients annoatation in the main class(annotated with @SpringBootApplication)

	<dependency>
	   <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	   <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-openfeign</artifactId>
	</dependency>

 
-->2.create an interface with @FeignClient annotation
	
	like :-

	  @FeignClient("patient-registration-service") -->need to mention which micro-service you want send the request or if you use api-gate-way provovide api-gateway application name
	  public interface Feignclient_Interaface
	  {

	  }

-->3.add method declaration in the interface and annotated with  to which req your sending(patient-registration-service controller which end point your sending add whole end point url)
	
	like:-

	 @FeignClient("patient-registration-service") -->need to mention which micro-service you want send the request
	  public interface Feignclient_Interaface
	  {
		@GetMapping("/patient/get-patient-by-id/{id}")
		public Patient getPatient(@PathVariable("id") long patientId);   -->create dto package->create class Patient(copy Patient in patient-registration-service service fields into this dto Patient class)
	  }
	  

4.call the method of interface in  the where patient details .
 	
	ex:- here i called in the controller where DoctorConsulatation saved time and i just printed the Patient details came from patient-registration-service micro

	@Autowired
	private OpenFeign_interface  openFeign_interface;

	/* save DoctorConsultation */
	@PostMapping("/save-DoctorConsultation")
	public ResponseEntity<DoctorConsultation> saveDoctorConsultation(
			@RequestBody DoctorConsultation doctorConsultation) {
		
		//called the method in  the interface(OpenFeign_interface) for fetching details from another micro
		Patient patientDetails = openFeign_interface.getPatientDetails(doctorConsultation.getPatientId());
		System.out.println(patientDetails);

		DoctorConsultation DoctorConsultation1 = doctorConsultationService.saveConsultation(doctorConsultation);

		if (DoctorConsultation1 != null) {

			return new ResponseEntity<>(DoctorConsultation1, HttpStatus.CREATED);
		} else {
		
			return new ResponseEntity<>(null, HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);

		}
	}

distributed tracing with mico-meter and zipkin
==================================================
-->distributed tracing means trace the request life-cycle
-->where req started from to where it's going ,like that,and we can identify in which micro req waited/spent more time,and we can find any bottlenecks ,etc...

1.Micrometer used for genarate tracing
2.Zipkin used for view the tracing


step-bystep
------------------------
1.add dependecies
2.install zipkin
3.rest api calls & view tracing info



1.dependencies 
----------------------
-->spring-boot-starter-actuator ==>it gives features for monitor and maintain our-application
-->micro-meter-tracing-bridge-brave  =>maintain tracing info
-->zipkin-reporter-brave              =>used send data of tracing which stored above dependency 


<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
    <artifactId>micrometer-tracing-bridge-brave</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.zipkin.reporter2</groupId>
    <artifactId>zipkin-reporter-brave</artifactId>    
</dependency>

yml file
--------------------
management:
   tracing:
     sampling:
       probability: 1.0


Note= give above dependecies and yml in every micro-service what ever you used(api-gateway,service-registry,doctor-consultation,patient-registration)


2.install zipkin
--------------------------
-->search in google zipkin download(https://zipkin.io/pages/quickstart.html)
-->if you are using java 17b or above then we can download zipkin by using java
quickstart(left side nav bar)
     |
   java
     |
latest release(click this)
     |
it downloaded jar file(open cmd where zipkin jar downloaded folder like downloads)
     |
java -jar zipkin-server-3.4.1-exec.jar   ( use this command(here java -jar zipkin_name.jar)  -->for to start zipkin we have to execute this to see tracing
     |
it will give url ( http://127.0.0.1:9411/) -->execute this in the browser 

     

Note= to see tracing then evry time need to execute zipkin jar file in cmd then it will give url then run the rest-api's and in the browser zipkin click run the query 
      then yo will find tracing
