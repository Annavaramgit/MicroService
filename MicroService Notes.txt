MicroServices
======================

-->microservices are modern approach in software where by application code devided in small, managable pieces,independent to others.
-->microservices are small small services they work together 
-->microservices are loosely coupled ->( meaning that changes to one service should not affect the other services )
-->it is distributed environemt =>not all application code at one place (based on modules devided diff applications)


Monolith Archetecture
===========================
-->Single and large Code Base  => whole code application available at one place
-->Single Stack                =>every modules in the application developed by one progarmming language(like java)
-->one time deployement for entire project=> means in the application if single modules got any issue then project not deployed 
-->tightly coupled =>all modules are tightly coupled each other
-->it is centalized environment  =>all application available at one place


MicroServices Communication
====================================
-->one micro service communicates with another microservice
-->there are ways for micro service communication
1)Synchronous 
2)Asyncronous


1)Synchronous 
-----------------
-->it means ,if one micro service send request another micro service 
-->in this sending micro service waits for the second micro service response
-->RestTemplate,SpringCloud using communications are Synchronous 

ex:
-----
phone call 
-->we waited untill another person giving the response

2)Asyncronous
---------------
-->it means ,if one micro service send request another micro service 
-->sending microservice will not wait for the second micro service for the response
-->RabbitMQ,Kafka are the example

ex:
-----
chatting(in whatsapp,etc..)
-->sending person put the message and not wait or stop his work for the response


Micro-service Architecture Components
=======================================================

Note = for architecture diagram search in google spring microservices(https://spring.io/microservices) then you will get official and in that diagram you will find

Api gateway
<============>
-->api gateway acts like gate for microservices
-->means every request go through this gateway only
-->every request come to api-gateway first  and then it will route correspondent micro-service
-->Api Gateway simplifies complexity of client & microservices communication



ConfigServer
<=============>
--> Actually a multiple micro-servives are develped in the micro-service based application
-->each micro-service is a application
-->so each application needs configurations
-->in ConfigServer means all the micro-services confifgurations are maintained here only
-->it is a centralized configurations maintainer
-->if i want change any particular micro-service configurations then no need to go that particular micro-service in configServer we can easily change


Circuit breaker
<=====================>
-->if two micro-services are there(One,Two)
-->if Two micro-service needs One microservice data
-->in case if One micro-service fails or notworking
-->that time we need to handle bcz Two micro-service don't know One micro-service is not working
-->for handling this kind of situation Circuit Breaker need to use

message borker
<===================>
-->apache kafka is a message broker
-->for communication of micro-service this message broker used

ex:zomato app
------------------
-->first order request came to one micro-service 
-->that micro-service intimate to kafka like hey order req came from clinet
-->then after payment micro-service handles payment process 
-->then payment handled micro-service intimate to kafka like either payment =sucess or payment=failure
-->based on kafka message sucess failure remaing will happen 


service-regstry
<===================>
-->for communication of micro-service then micro-service n/w location of that commuinicated micro-service then only communicate
-->instaed of hardcoding n/w location use eurka server 
-->euraka server is a service-registry and discovery server or sevice
-->when the micro-services running/startup they registed in the euraka server itself then euraka know his n/w location
-->so through this eureka micro-services communicate each other
